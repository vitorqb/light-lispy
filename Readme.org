** Why?
   
   Lispy is fantastic. Really. It is amazing.

   But sometimes I wished I had *only* the structural editting that comes
   with lispy, and nothing else. No magic (even though the magic is great
   when you need it!)

   So I copied part the part of the code with the structural editting that
   I actually used here.
